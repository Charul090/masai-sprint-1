                    <p>Newly formed Tropical Cyclone Uesi has the potential to strengthen further before spreading heavy rain and gusty winds to New Caledonia.
                        Meteorologists have been monitoring a tropical low that has been nearly stationary just south of the Solomon Islands since late last week.                        
                        After battling moderate wind shear, the low began to drift south on Sunday where it moved into an area more conducive for tropical development.
                        The storm developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and was given the name Uesi by the Fiji Meteorological Service. This is equivalent to a tropical storm in the Atlantic and East Pacific Basins.

                    <p>Cyclone Damien is continuing to wreak havoc across the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with Karratha Airport shut down throughout the morning and authorities warning the clean-up could take weeks if not months.
                       Hundreds of people were today affected by flight cancellations, with flooding and electrical damage forcing the closure of the state's second-busiest airport through the morning. It reopened shortly after midday.

                    <p>A "bomb" cyclone with a central pressure of 929 millibars (mb) has formed between Greenland and Iceland, while another deep low pressure area has opened up over the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.
                        A "bomb" cyclone is defined as a low pressure area that deepens by at least 24mb in 24 hours.
                        The storm over Canada has been encouraged by a jetstream at the top of the atmosphere, about 12km up, blowing at 400km per hour. This wind defines the meeting of two air masses, one Arctic in origin and the other more tropical.
                        The cyclone over Nova Scotia is at the head of a frontal boundary that, over the past two days has brought tornadoes, gales, flooding rain and snow from Texas to Tennessee to Connecticut.
